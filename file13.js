//how javascript works
//js compiles whole code before execution
//means js looks at the whole code before execution

//it happens in 3 steps 1=> is lexical analysis/Tokenization: The source code is broken down into individual tokens, such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals

//2=>parsing:The tokens are then analyzed and structured into an abstract syntax tree (AST)
//3=>Code Generation: The final step is to generate executable code from the optimized IR(intermediate representation) or AST.

//why compilation before execution
//early error checking and determining appropriate scope for variable
